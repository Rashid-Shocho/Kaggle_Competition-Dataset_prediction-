This repository is a collection of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) projects applied to different datasets. Each project focuses on solving prediction tasks such as classification, regression, and forecasting. The repo demonstrates the complete workflow â€” from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model building, training, and evaluation.

It is designed as a learning and reference hub, showing how different ML and DL algorithms perform on diverse datasets.
